# R-maps
R code for creating maps using choropleth and ggmaps

Choropleth maps are a great way to plot spatial data. We can manipulate the data and use built in maps to create a wide variety of plots. ggmap goes a step beyond and provides countless map resources to plot data using ggplot features. All code have been referred from the official choropleth and ggmap package definition.
